# R and R Studio 

## Why R?

Short answer: R is a free and open programming language that helps you teach a computer to perform a "data science" task. Note that R was designed to do statistics/data science from the conception and has evolved that way. 

What did I mean by teaching a computer? At a very high-level, computers do four things: running programming, storing data, communicating with each other, and interacting with us. You can interact with a computer (teach a computer to perform a task you desire) mainly using your mouse (Graphic User Interface; point and click) or typing (Command-Line Interface).

Q: I heard that Python is very popular, why R not Python? 

A: Either language can you help you to do data science and learn how a programming language works. Here's a more educated explanation comes from Hadley Wickham the Chief Scientist of RStudio. 

>> "For R and Python, Python is first and foremost a programming language. And that has a lot of good features, but it tends to mean, that if you are going to do data science in Python, you have to first learn how to program in Python. Whereas I think you are going to get up and running faster with R, than with Python because there's just a bunch more stuff built in and you don't have to learn as many programming concepts. You can focus on being a great political scientist or whatever you do and learning enough R that you don't have to become an expert programmer as well to get stuff done." - Hadley Wickham
       
- However, this feature of the R community also raises a challenge. 
      
>> Compared to other programming languages, the R community tends to be more focused on results instead of processes. Knowledge of software engineering best practices is patchy: for instance, not enough R programmers use source code control or automated testing. Inconsistency is rife across contributed packages, even within base R. You are confronted with over 20 years of evolution every time you use R. R is not a particularly fast programming language, and poorly written R code can be terribly slow. R is also a profligate user of memory. - Hadley Wickham
  
- RStudio, especially the tidyverse team, has made heroic efforts to amend the problems listed above. We will learn some of these recent advances in the R ecosystem today and tomorrow.

## R Installation 

Installation method varies by your OS. For more information, visit [The R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).

Credit: Thanks to [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) for providing installation guidelines.

- Windows
Install R by downloading and running this .exe file from CRAN. Also, please install the RStudio IDE. All you need is RStudio Desktop.

- Mac OS X
Install R by downloading and running this .pkg file from CRAN. Also, please install the RStudio IDE. All you need is RStudio Desktop. Please note that if you already have R and update to a newer version, you will have to reinstall any previously installed packages.

- Linux
You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for Fedora run sudo yum install R). Also, please install the RStudio IDE. All you need is RStudio Desktop.

## What's RStudio?

RStudio (dashboard) is a tool that can help you interact with R (engine). For more information, visit the [RStudio homepage](https://www.rstudio.com/). As in the case of R installation, RStudio installation varies by your OS.

The other worth noticing thing about RStudio is it's specially designed for R. So if you intend to learn R and a beginning programmer, then RStudio is a good choice.

# Getting started in R

In R Studio, there are two main ways of interacting with R: using the console or using script files (plain text files containing your code).

As for the source files, you can use a pure R script or an R markdown file (that's a mix of code and texts).

## R markdown

- What is R markdown? An R package, developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/), provides an authoring framework for data science. Xie is also a developer of many widely popular R packages such as `knitr`, [`xaringan`](https://GitHub.com/yihui/xaringan) (cool kids use xaringan not [Beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)) these days), `blogdown` (used to create [my personal website](https://jaeyk.GitHub.io/)), and `bookdown` (used to create this book) among many others.

  - Many applications: [reports](https://rstudio.GitHub.io/distill/basics.html), [presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html), [dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), [websites](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/websites.html)  
  - Check out [Communicating with R markdown workshop](https://ysc-rmarkdown.netlify.app/) by [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) (RStudio)
    - Alison Hill is a co-author of [`blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown.`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 
  - Key strengths: dynamic reporting + reproducible science + easy deployment
  
- R Markdown basic syntax 

```{r}
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

- Use these section headers to indicate workflow.

```{r}
# Import packages and data
# Tidy data
# Wrangle data
# Model data
# Visualize data
```

## Console 

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting, or sent from the script editor using `Ctrl-Enter`; `Command-Enter` will also work on Macs), R will try to execute it, and when ready, show the results and come back with a new `>`-prompt to wait for further commands. This is the equivalent of the `$` in your terminal. 

## Basic Syntax

**Comments**

Use `#` signs to comment. Comment liberally in your R scripts. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored by R. For those of you familiar with other languages, there is no doc string, or equivalent to `"""` in R.

**Assignment operator**

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3`. The arrow can be read as 3 **goes into** `x`.  You can also use `=` for assignments. 

```{r}
USweird <- "Why use lb for pound!" # Use this
"Why use lb for pound!" = USweird
```

Nonetheless, *can* do not mean you *should*. It is good practice to use `<-` for assignments. `=` should only be used to specify the values of arguments of functions. This is what Google and Hadley Wickham recommend as well. If they don't convince you enough, here's [a real example](https://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/assignment-operators-in-r-vs/).

```{r}
mean(x = 1:10) # Does it save x?
rm(x)
mean(x <- 1:10) # Does it save x?
rm(x)
```

**Printing**

In R, an object's contents can be printed by either simply executing the object name or calling the ```print()``` function.

**Help**

* `?` + object opens a help page for that specific object
* `??` + object searches help pages containing the name of the object

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?mean
??mean
help(mean)
# The above three will do the same. 
example(ls) # provides an example(s) for how to use ls 
help.search("visualization") # search functions and packages that have "visualization" in their descriptions
```

## Environment 

Environment = a collection of pairs 

### Objects 

- List objects in your current environment

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create a numeric object 
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
# List the object 
ls()
# Remove the object 
rm(x)
```

- Remove objects from your current environment

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Create an object 
x <- 5
# Remove the object 
rm(x)
```

- Remove all objects from your current environment

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create an object 
a <- 7
b <- 3
# Remove the object 
rm(list = ls())
```

- Force memory release 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Garbage collect; for more information, type ?gc() 
gc()
```

### Packages 

`install.packages(package-name)` will download a package from one of the CRAN mirrors, assuming that a binary is available for your operating system. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# From CRAN
install.packages("dplyr") 
# Load package 
library(dplyr)

# From GitHub 
#devtools::install_GitHub("jaeyk/tidytweetjson") # my own package 
# Unload package 
# detach("package:stats", unload=TRUE)
```

**Tips**

If you have multiple packages to install, then please consider using pacman package. The following is the example. First, you install pacman. Then, you load several libraries by using `p_load()` method.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Lots of copying and pasting
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("broom")

#library(ggplot2)
#library(dplyr)
#library(broom)

install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  ggplot2,
  dplyr, 
  broom
)
```

If you don't like to use `pacman`, then the other option is to create a list (we're going to learn what is list soon).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pkgs <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "broom")
install.packages(pkgs)
```
  
Still, we have to write two lines. The simpler, the better, right? Here's another approach that can simplify the code further.

Note that `lapply()` applies (there's a family of apply functions) a function to a list. In this case, library to pkgs. apply is an advanced concept, which is related to anonymous functions. We will learn about it later when we study functions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
inst <- lapply(pkgs, library, 
               character.only = TRUE)
```

### Computational reproducibility

* Replication = code + data 

* Computational reproduciblity = code + data + environment + distribution 

* Reproducibility checklist by [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/)

    1. Start with science (avoid vague questions and concepts)
    
    2. Don't do things by hand (not only about automation but also documentation)
    
    3. Don't point and click (same problem)
    
    4. Teach a computer (automation also solves documentation to some extent)
    
    5. Use some version control 
    
    6. Don't save output (instead, keep the input and code)
    
    7. Set your seed 
    
    8. Think about the entire pipeline 

![](https://GitHub.com/dlab-berkeley/efficient-reproducible-project-management-in-R/blob/master/misc/screenshot.png?raw=true)

If you care about computational reproducibility, you might be interested in using RStudio project and `here` package. The key idea is what should be treated as permanent (i.e., READ-ONLY raw data) and what should be treated as disposable (e.g., sessions, outputs). 

- First, I will demonstrate how RStudio project works and then how you should set up your RStudio global settings for workspace.

- Second, I will explain why `here()` is a better option than using `getwd()`.

- Below is what a typical R script looks like. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Remove objects 
rm(list = ls())

# Set a working directory 
setwd("/home/jae/starwars")

# Do something 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()
# Export the object. 
# dot means the working directory set by setwd()

ggsave("./outputs/example.png") # This is called relative path 
```

Instead you can just do this.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Remove objects 
rm(list = ls())

# Set a working directory 
setwd("/home/jae/starwars")

# Do something 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()
# Export the object. 
# dot means the working directory set by setwd()

# The same as above 
ggsave(here::here("outputs", # depth 1 
                  "example.png")) # depth 2
```
